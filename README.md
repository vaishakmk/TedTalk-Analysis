Project Idea: YouTube is the second most visited website in the world after Google hosting 122 million
active users daily. The website’s recommendation system is very powerful providing accurate suggestions to
engage the users on their app for a longer duration. In this project we plan to work on a small subset of the
vast content that YouTube has, focusing only on Ted Talk videos. As a user, you most likely use YouTube for
entertainment. However, TedTalks being informative and inspirational engages a user solely on the basis of
its contents. Our objective is to use various data mining techniques on the Ted Talk to gain insights and make
meaningful recommendations entirely focused on the talk content rather than user data.
Our dataset consists of 3 files containing: Speaker data, Talk data, Talk transcript. We use the details of the
speaker, the view count, number of likes etc. along with the transcript to find similar ted talks

Brief description of the steps:
1. Cleaning the dataset
2. Exploration of dataset
3. Feature set generation
4. Training and testing on multiple models for recommender systems.
5. Generating visual insights
